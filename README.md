Typically, summarization methods are evaluated based on the Rouge metric. This method uses assigns higher scores to summaries that have more overlapping words/n-grams in common with the original text. I believe that this evaluation fails to account for another one of the main purposes of summarization - to make the text more comprehendible for the reader. In this project, I implement 3 different summarization methods - extractive, abstractive, and a hybrid approach - and evaluate them not only using the Rouge metric, but also the level of improved readability.
